# [Trial by pseudo code](https://github.com/becodeorg/BXL-Swartz-4-27/blob/master/1.The-Field/7.Algorithmic/07-trial.adoc)
* Type of challenge: **consolidation**
* Duration: **2 hours**
* Turn in method: **email**
* Team challenge: **solo**

## Missions objectives
At the end of this challenge you should have improved your understanding of:
* variables
* conditions
* loops
* arrays
* functions

## The mission
Now that you know the fundamental concepts of programming, itâ€™s time to test your newly acquired knowledge in a trial. Complete the exercises below in a [text file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file), then send it to your coach by **email**.

## Exercises
Instructions
* complete the exercises in a text file
* send the file to your coach

*I will be using [Python3](https://repl.it/languages/python3) to write and test the algorithms*

I - list of random numbers
- [ ] Write a function which returns an array of *n* random numbers, *n* being the **only** received **parameter**.

II - translate
- [ ] The main goal of pseudo code is to write down the logic behind an algorithm, so that you can easily **translate** it into *human speech* or *code*.

Given the algorithm below
* with your word explain its purpose
* translate it into *Python* and *Javascript*
```
function in_array(element,list_elements) {
	boolean exist = false
	for I = 0 until length($list_elements) do {
		if $element == $list_elements[I] then {
			$exist = true
		}
	}
	return $exist
}
```

III - sort an array
- [ ] Write a function which receives an array of ten random integers as **parameter** and returns an ascendantly ordered array of integers.
